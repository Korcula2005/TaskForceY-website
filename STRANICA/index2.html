"Alex Sander grew up as an orphan on the streets of London, where he found the will to survie through stealing. 
His gang eventually gained respect as he got older because of the infamous heists they pulled in 2000s.
One of the factors to those heists is him unlocking his meta-human powers simply dubbed as "Rewind".

His powers allows him to turn back time 30 seconds, in which he could move freely and change the outcome of
future events without breaking time and reality itself. It is noted that time returns back to normal if he
touches anything in that time frame, and that he can use that power 3 times per day as usage of that more than 
3 times could actaully kill him.

Origin of his powers is unique and unknown. We took the misson on figuring who his parents were so we could have
better understanding of his powers. Some came up with temporary answers, one of them being that he is child
of <mark style="background-color:black">John Constantine</mark> and a prostitute, or child of 
<mark style="background-color:black">Zatanna Zatara</mark> 
and <mark style="background-color:black">Bruce Wayne</mark>. Further research is needed.

When he turned 17, he left his gang as his greed for stealing grew too ambitious for his friends. From there 
he started to use his nickname; Flashback. His apperance resembles of clasic Viktorian age outfit of 1800s.
He usually covers his face up to the nose with black balaclava and his eyes with black stained aviator glasess.

Sam Fisher and his Squad Zero captured him in Germany just as he was trying to escape with crown of Bavaria.
It is worth metioning we set him up for that heist. He was the first member we captured back in winter of 2021.
Soon he and his squad charlie will be sent on their mission in Venice."
